# Card Panda

Bare bones, fast storage and retrieval of barcodes.

## Once upon a time...

...there was an app called Stocard. It stored cards - loyalty cards, principally - so that you could scan their barcodes easily from the app, without needing to carry them all around. It had some other features but was overall simple and fast.

Stocard got purchased and its feature set integrated into an application that was, at least on my own phone, neither as simple nor as fast. With each update load times seemed to get longer, and more and more nag screens for new features would appear. Some peopled like those new features and appreciated the updates to the app, but I wasn't so sure.

Enter Card Panda. This application isn't about aesthetics or features. You can:

* Scan a barcode with your camera, or enter its number by hand
* See a list of those items
* View them for, say, scanning at a checkout

That's all it does and all it will ever do!

## Privacy

Data is stored in your personal iCloud account. Absolutely no data other than the barcode numbers, types and the names you give them is stored there. Absolutely _nothing_ else is stored or transmitted by the app anywhere.
